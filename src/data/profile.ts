  aboutBio: [
    "I’m <strong>Gordon Bie</strong>, a third-year <strong>Information Systems and International Business</strong> student at <strong>Northeastern University</strong>, graduating in <strong>April 2027</strong>. My path into data science was unconventional—moving from international relations to business before discovering programming and data analytics, which immediately hooked me.",
    "Since then, I’ve developed a strong interest in <strong>ML</strong> through projects, research, and leadership roles. I’m currently a <strong>tech lead at Generate</strong>, will be interning at <strong>Johnson & Johnson</strong>, and previously interned at <strong>State Street</strong>. I’m focused on applying <strong>state-of-the-art AI</strong> to real-world problems.",
    "Originally from <strong>Vancouver, BC</strong> and now based in <strong>Boston, MA</strong>, I enjoy cooking, gaming with friends, burgers, matcha, movies, and exploring fashion outside of class and work.",
